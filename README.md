# Analysis of Bitcoin Transactions Dataset

Some interesting analysis of Bitcoint Transaction Dataset, using Python and Matplotlib, numpy and many other useful lib.

The dataset starts from the genesis block and ends at height 100,001, which is the
block mined on 29-12-2010. 
The data is slightly modified with respect to the
original Bitcoin blockchain, and some transactions have been removed.
